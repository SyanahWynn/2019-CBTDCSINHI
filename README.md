# Cerebellar Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Improves Reactive Response Inhibition in Healthy Volunteers
Here you will find the analysis script used in the aformentioned published paper. The script was not created to be widely used by others, so may not be user-friendly. The scripts were altered by deleting redundancy and remove participant-specific steps. In this way, readability and generalizability has increased.

# Experimental Design
The experimental designs were adjusted from E-prime tasks obtained from collegues, so are not shared here.

# Analysis
Here you will find the analysis script used to process the data for subsequent statistical tests. This version is an adjusted version of the script, which is altered after the publication to improve readability. The main purpose of the script is to transfer the variables from .txt files e-prime creates, to a .mat file.
